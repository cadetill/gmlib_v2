@abstract(A TGMLatLng is a point in geographical coordinates: latitude and longitude.)

@unorderedList(
  @item(Latitude ranges between -90 and 90 degrees, inclusive. Values above or below this range will be clamped to the range [-90, 90]. This means that if the value specified is less than -90, it will be set to -90. And if the value is greater than 90, it will be set to 90.)
  @item(Longitude ranges between -180 and 180 degrees, inclusive. Values above or below this range will be wrapped so that they fall within the range. For example, a value of -190 will be converted to 170. A value of 190 will be converted to -170. This reflects the fact that longitudes wrap around the globe.)

Although the default map projection associates longitude with the x-coordinate of the map, and latitude with the y-coordinate, the latitude coordinate is always written first, followed by the longitude.@br@br
