# Google Maps Library v2

Google Maps Library is an open source library that encapsulates the Google Maps API. Compatible with TEdgeBrowser (RADStudio 11 and later) and TChromium (CEF4Delphi by Salvador Díaz Fau) it is compiled in RAD Studio 11 (Delphi and C++).

It can be compiled in earlier versions, but only maintaining compatibility with TChromium.

For more information about CEF4Delphi see [this link](https://github.com/salvadordf/CEF4Delphi).

GMLib was developed and tested on Delphi 11.1 but (theoretically) you can compile it in previous versions that include generics and the new Json units.

GMLib demos have been tested in Windows 10 and Windows 11.
